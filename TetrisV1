The best language to code Tetris depends on your goals and experience. Popular choices include:

- Python (easy to learn, good for beginners, use with Pygame)
- JavaScript (runs in browsers, easy to share)
- C++ or C# (for performance, use with game engines like Unity or SDL)
- Java (cross-platform, good libraries)

For learning and prototyping, Python with Pygame is highly recommended. For web-based Tetris, use JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas.
